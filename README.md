\## 📘 Project Description



The \*\*Customer Ledger dApp\*\* is a decentralized application built on the Flare Coston2 test network.  

It enables users and businesses to maintain a tamper-proof, fully on-chain ledger of customers.  

Each customer record includes:



\- A blockchain address  

\- A customer name  

\- A balance that can be increased or decreased  



The ledger ensures high transparency, immutability, and decentralization—ideal for bookkeeping, credit systems, or tracking user balances securely.

\## 💡 How It Solves Real Problems



Traditional ledger systems rely heavily on centralized databases that:



\- Can be manipulated  

\- Can be lost due to corruption  

\- Require trust in the server owner  

\- Lack transparency for auditing  



This project solves these issues:



\### \*\*Immutable Customer Records\*\*

Once stored on the blockchain, customer data cannot be altered maliciously.



\### \*\*Decentralized Balance Updates\*\*

Balances are updated through verified transactions, making them traceable and tamper-proof.



\### \*\*Transparent Auditing\*\*

Any user can inspect the records via contract functions or blockchain explorers.



\### \*\*Use Cases\*\*

\- Small business bookkeeping  

\- Credit systems  

\- Decentralized finance tools  

\- Membership or loyalty programs  

\- Ledger for peer-to-peer lending  



\### \*\*Benefits\*\*

\- Increased trust  

\- Zero downtime  

\- Full transparency  

\- Secure and tamper-proof data storage
